If you did NOT request to verify this email address, do not click on the link. Please note that many times, the situation isn't a phishing attempt, but either a misunderstanding of how to use our service, or someone setting up email-sending capabilities on your behalf as part of a legitimate service, but without having fully communicated the procedure first.
